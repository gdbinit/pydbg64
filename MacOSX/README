PyDBG64 - OS X PyDbg with 64 bits support

Original OS X port by Charlie Miller
Fixes and 64 bits support by fG!, reverser@put.as - http://reverse.put.as
 
Welcome,

This is an updated version of PyDbg for OS X that supports 64 bits targets.
It still does not support all features available in the Windows version but it can already be
used for scripted debugging of 32 and 64bits OS X targets.

One special feature that I have added is the possibility to install hardware breakpoints per thread
and have breakpoint handlers for each thread.

It supports the libdasm disassembler library and also distorm3. I have uploaded the libdasm version
that I use into the github repo with a small fix to multi-byte nops.

At this moment I have no idea if this is compatible with Pai Mei framework. In principle the 32bits
part should work, but I barely used Pai Mei so it's untested.

There are still some missing features on the macdll that I am working at and will update.

The single-step feature is in an unstable state. Apple for some weird reason cleans the CPU resume
flag so kernel needs to be patched. I need to verify in what state I left this, two years ago ;-)

Many thanks go to the company that indirectly sponsored this update :-) !

Tested with Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x.
You need to use the python version correspondent to your target, python-32 for 32bits, and 
python-64 for 64bits. Macdll by default compiles to a fat binary :-)

From the old instructions, what you need is the pydasm install and python procmod permissions.
You also need to compile the macdll and copy it to pydbg folder.

This is still quite a hack but it should work! I hope to get this into a more stable state soon.

Contributions are welcome :-)

Enjoy,
fG!

**** OLD INSTRUCTIONS, TO BE UPDATED ****

Welcome to Pai Mei/PyDbg for Mac OS X.  This code is still under development so probably has bugs.  Please 
report them.  I'll try to fix them but it may take a bit.  I'll happily accept patches :):):)

There are 2 directories.  The first is the Pai mei directory.  It is a fork from a couple of years ago.  It 
didn't change much at all compared to that time, but unfortunately the project moved on and so its quite different
from the latest snapshot.  The other is macdll which is a dylib that converts windows API calls to things a mac 
can understand.  Its like a 1% implementation of wine.  You need to place this dylib in the pydbg directory (there
is already a copy there) or somewhere it is globally available (see macdll/README).  

Below are instructions to install and test pydbg.
